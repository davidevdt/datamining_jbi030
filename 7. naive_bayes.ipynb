    "The posterior probability of class $n$ (*none contact lenses*) in this last example is equal to 0. This is due to the fact that, within the class *none contact lenses*, there was no observation having *Tear production rate=normal*. However, it seems quite implausible that in the whole population there won't be any patient having normal tear production rate, without contact lenses prescription ($Y=n$). In this case Naive Bayes is trained with probabilities that are too *sample-specific* (and therefore it is led to overfit). Note that the same problem may arise when we had to classify an observation having *reduced* tear production rate in the *soft* and *hard* contact lenses classes, or with *no astigmatism* in the same classes.  \n",

This will *smooth* the resulting probabilities, avoiding degenerate solutions as in the case above. For this reason, such operation is called *smoothing*. The new feature-specific probabilities are then computed as follows (remember that $S_j$ is the number of categories of feature $X_j$):\n",

    "* It supports multi-class classification\n",
    "* It is effective for predictions, as posterior probabilities need to assign the observations to the right side of the boundary, and need not be completely accurate \n",
    "* Naive Bayes, given its good performance in high dimensions, is widely used in document classification and spam e-mail detection\n",
    "* More information about the theory of Naive Bayes can be found in the [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html#multinomial-naive-bayes)\n",
    "* If the conditional independence (and Gaussian, in Gaussian Naive Bayes) assumption holds, the model reaches the best possible accuracy... \n",
    "* ...but this is rarely the case, and to the extent that these assumptions are violated, performance of Naive Bayes will deteriorate. In this plot you can see an example where the conditional independence is clearly violated: \n",

    "* It is possible to show (mathematically) that, when the variances of the features are the same for all classes, Naive Bayes builds a linear boundary (indeed, in the limit it provides the same boundary as logistic regression). When the variances differ, the boundary becomes quadratic: \n",

In the dataset of this example, a vocabulary was built starting from the original messages, so that each column corresponds to a word of the vocabulary, and each row to a different message. (Note that a word can also be a single character). The feature values measure how many times the corresponding word appears in the message.
